Project Name: PERN Stack Data Management Application

Description:

This project is a robust data management application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It offers a seamless experience for users to interact with their data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Features:

Data Representation: Utilizing React.js, the application elegantly renders user data in tabular columns, ensuring a visually intuitive experience.
Search Functionality: Users can efficiently search through their data with a powerful search feature, enhancing accessibility and productivity.
Sorting Capabilities: The application provides sorting functionality, enabling users to organize data based on various parameters, including date and time.
Pagination: With pagination, users can navigate through large datasets easily, enhancing user experience and performance.
How it Works:

Backend: Node.js with Express.js is employed to handle server-side logic, facilitating seamless communication with the PostgreSQL database. Data retrieval and manipulation are efficiently managed in the backend.
Frontend: React.js powers the frontend, delivering a dynamic and responsive user interface. The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch and display data, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience for users.
